Secret Hitler: Consolidator Edition for Tabletop Simulator

Requires Atom Editor and the Tabletop Simulator package. See https://api.tabletopsimulator.com/atom/ for full details.

In the Settings for Packages->tabletopsimulator-lua, make sure the 'Insert other files specified in source code' box is checked.

Set the 'Base path for files you wish to #include' to the local parent folder of this repository.

For example, if you have this repository saved in 'D:\Documents\My Games\Tabletop Simulator\Scripts\SecretHitlerCE', set the base path to 'D:\Documents\My Games\Tabletop Simulator\Scripts'

If you want to edit the scripts directly from the temp folder, uncheck the 'Insert other files specified in source code' box and reload the scripts in Atom.

Note: Tabs are used to save space in the resulting .json file and I use a tab length of 3.
